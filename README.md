**IATI Studio** is an initiative launched by the Humanitarian AI Meetup community to help nonprofits and their supporters channel information on activities, transactions and results through open data sharing frameworks like **IATI**, making the information accessible to emerging artificial intelligent applications and virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa. 
 
IATI is an **XML standard** widely used by nonprofit organizations, government and United Nations agencies, and donors to convert information on aid activities, transactions and results into a format that's traversable by machine applications. IATI Studio is a narrowly focused content and design studio set up to concentrate on helping nonprofits and donors publish IATI XML files and optimize reporting for question answering algorithms.
